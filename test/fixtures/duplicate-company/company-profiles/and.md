# &yet (And Yet)

## Company blurb
[&yet](https://andyet.com) is about people. We’re known as a design and development consultancy (specializing in Node, React, and realtime), but we don’t fit neatly in a box.

We design and [develop custom software](https://andyet.com/software) for web, mobile, desktop, chat, and voice.

We enable millions of people to make super simple video calls with [Talky](https://talky.io).

We pioneer software and standards for [realtime communications](https://andyet.com/realtime).

We [wrote the book](https://gatherthepeople.com) on taking a human approach to marketing for people who would rather make what they love than persuade people to buy it.

We create high-impact conference experiences such as [RealtimeConf](http://experience.realtimeconf.com) and more recently–[&yetConf](http://andyetconf.com).

## Company size
20+

## Remote status
We employ several strategies to ensure an inclusive and collaborative environment for all our employees.

To communicate we use [Slack](https://slack.com) (text-chat), our own product [Talky](https://talky.io) (video chat and meetings), [Twist](https://twistapp.com) (daily check-ins) and [GitHub](https://github.com) (organization wide discussions).

One-on-ones and bi-weekly company-wide updates are a crucial part of staying connected and understanding our team as things change. We encourage employees to use these meetings to bring up frustrations, ideas, or whatever they need in order to be their best selves and to do their best work.

At least once a year we organize an in-person all-hands team week. It’s the best.
